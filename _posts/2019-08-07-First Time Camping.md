title: First Time Camping
---

<p>Summer is a great time to be outdoors, of course, and a great way to spend that time outdoors is camping. Did you cringe? Did the thought of squatting in a bush or even worse sitting on the dreaded port-a-potty have your cursor moving toward the little red X up there? Yeah, I understand.</p>

<p>I love camping, okay…. glamping. Growing up my family always had RV campers and I always had a clean toilet. A clean toilet is great for me because I have this irrational fear that down in the netherworld or feces in that big black stinky hole lives a humanoid creature just waiting to pull me in. So, port-a-potties are a no go for me.</p> 

<p>I’ve been trying to get Garrett to go camping with me for a while and finally last September he agreed. We had tons of fun out at Alcova Lake here in Wyoming. It is a big beautiful lake with wonderful views. We went out on a friend’s boat and spent all day in the water. Finn has so much fun though he didn’t think Dad being pulled behind the boat on a tube all that great. After a day on the water came the late-night talks around the camp fire. I don’t know why it seems the best conversations happen around a fire.</p>

<p>Then the fire died down and it was time for bed. In a tent. On an air mattress. My husband was commando and I was in jeans because for some reason underwear and pajamas did not make it into the weekend bag. (Oopse) So, we are freezing and extremely uncomfortable when we wake up to a completely deflated mattress in the middle of the night. Needless to say, that was the last time my husband wanted to go camping.</p> 

<p>Until just this last weekend when Garretts wonderful and glorious parents bought a camper.</p>
	
<p>Now I have been camping in a camper before sure, but I have never set up a camper or knew anything about running one. So when I say that it was the best weekend ever, everything worked perfectly, and my dog Harper definitely did not roll around on the carcass of some poor animal, you know it’s a flat out lie.</p>

<p>My husband’s exact words were, “Camping in a tent was easier”.</p>

<p>To begin the camper had a flat tire, easy fix and not a huge hiccup. Next, the previous owners who certainly winterized the RV (can you taste the sarcasm) left the septic tank full and the kitchen sink pipe was cracked. Luckily Garrett’s father is extremely handy and had the sink fixed easily because Garrett and I would have just cried.</p>

<p>Once all the little hiccups we made it to the perfect spot, get the RV leveled, the food in the fridge, and the beloved AC running. Everything is great. Then I open the fridge to start lunch and everything in the camper dies. It took us about an hour of flipping breakers and restarting the generator to realize that the generator is too small. The generator we bought was about 25 amps whereas the AC alone needs 30 amps. (Face Palm)</p>

<p>We made it so we at least had AC for the kiddo and luckily the battery ran the toilet so no port-a-potty monster for me. Speaking of the toilet, that was a treat to empty.</p>

<p>Even though we had some learning curves thrown at us we had fun. We laughed through the mistakes and enjoyed the view.</p>
