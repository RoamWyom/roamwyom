Welcome to RoamWyom! My name is Ali and I’m so excited you’re here! This blog is to document my adventures with my family. I am a wife, a mother, and a student. My little family and I live in Wyoming and love to explore not only all of the beautiful places Wyoming has to offer but also indoors through new hobbies. Here at RoamWyom we will share with you our journey in all things travel, hobbies, and life. 

At the time of this post I am 25 about to be 26, my husband Garrett is 27, and our wonderful little boy Finnick is just about to turn 3. (Seriously three already!) my husband is a computer wiz and you have him to thank for this beautiful website. I am an explorer in soap making, gardening, and writing. My son is a wild little boy who loves to get dirty and be outdoors. 

We are far from a perfect family (is there a perfect family?) but we love each other, have fun together, and are very happy. In future posts I will discuss the good, the bad, and the funny as my family and I roam through life together. So please roam freely and enjoy the journey.
