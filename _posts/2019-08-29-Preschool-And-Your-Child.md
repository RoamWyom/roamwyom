title: Preschool, And Your Child
---

<h1>Summer is just about over,</h1> <p>after the long Labor Day weekend school starts. And for many that is just another day, but for me that means my little boy is starting preschool. Which means in two years he will be in kindergarten which means another twelve years until he graduates. You know they always tell new parents that time flies by quickly, but I don’t think anyone can really tell you just how fast.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing about my son going to preschool, he doesn’t really have a schedule. He goes to bed with us because he still sleeps with us. That may be more my fault than his. He wakes up when he wants unless I must work earlier than usual and he runs the house, literally, and most times in just his underwear.</p>

<p>He is a smart kid, knows his ABC’s for the most part, can play well with other children, and can identify his name when he sees it. I’m not worried about that part of school. What I am worried about is that not only do I work at this preschool, his grandma owns it. Yeah, so you can imagine how well he is going to listen.</p>

<p>This is going to be as much of a struggle for me as it will be for him. An adventure for sure. First things first, however, I need to get him on a schedule. Now if you are in the same boat as me, I think we can agree that potty training was easier than getting your child to sleep in his/her bed after 3 years of co-sleeping. Last night for example I was really impressed with myself. Dinner was given, play time was had, teeth were brushed, and my son was in bed by 8pm. I even got a bit of studying done. Then it was 8:30 ...”I need an apple sauce!”……9Pm, “I need to go potty”…suddenly it was 10:30 and I was laying in bed with him in the dark and this kid was talking about everything and anything. Well, eleven o’clock rolls around and I gave up. He came into bed with me and fell right asleep.</p>

<p>So, now the next morning I am sitting here trying to figure out the best ways to get my child into a good nighttime routine feeling like I somehow failed him for not doing this earlier. I have done some research, and these are the ideas I will try and see which works best.

<h2>1. Sleep friendly.</h2>

<p>The first thing that I kept seeing on all the articles I’ve read is to make the child’s room “sleep friendly” so that’s what I did. I cleaned out most of his toys (which I needed to do anyway with his birthday coming up). I plugged in a night light. Washed his bed sheets and kept his room clean. I know I always sleep better when my room is clean.</p>

<h2>2. Explain why.</h2>

<p>Next I need to explain why he needs to start sleeping in his own bed. This my husband and I have done multiple times I just don’t think he cares about the “you’re a big boy now” reasoning, it didn’t work with potty training either. My child is stubborn like his father if he doesn’t want to do something there is very little I can say to change their minds. So, this step has been unhelpful.</p>

<h2>3. Have him sleep in your room but not on the bed.</h2>

<p>We tried this method and it worked for about a week. It is too easy for him to wake up and climb in bed with us and at one in the morning I am too tired to care about putting my foot down. I also think the environment in our bedroom is not suitable for this method because we have three dogs that wander in and out at night. One of the dogs being a puppy we are still in the process of potty training. I think this method would be great for those with little to no interruptions at night.</p>

<h2>4. A bedtime routine.</h2>

<p>This particular step has been hard during the summer. With vacations, camping, or just summer night fun we haven’t been able to set a nightly routine for our son. This I want to get back into doing. Bath time, books, and lights out by a certain time.</p>

<h2>5. A reward system.</h2>

<p>A reward system I can get behind 100%. We used a reward system with potty training, and it was the only thing that worked. I don’t know why I haven’t tried it yet. With potty training we took our son to the dollar store and let him fill a box with toys that he would get to have after using the toilet. It was extremely effective. I will try this method again.</p>

<h2>6. Be consistent and firm.</h2>

<p>I am not let them cry it out person. If you are that’s great, I don’t judge but my little heart can’t take it. I am a softy when it comes to my child and emotional animated movies. So, when my son wakes up crying and asking for me in the middle of the night, I am going to hold him and let him sleep with me. My husband is a little stricter so maybe it would be best to have him send him back to bed the nights he wakes up. </p>

<h3>I will try all these steps and methods in the coming weeks and see what works best. It will be an adventure for us all. Parenting always will be.</h3>
