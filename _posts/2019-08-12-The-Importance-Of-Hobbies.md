title: The Importance Of Hobbies
---

<h1>Hobbies are important.</h1>

 <p>As a mother, wife, student, and part time worker I find it difficult to have hobbies and to keep up with them. However, I know that when I didn’t have anything for me to work on and challenge myself with it really put me into a slump. I felt like I was doing the same thing every day, and nothing was really for myself. </p>

<p>I made a change with the help from my cousin who is a life coach and is a miracle worker. (I'll post her website link below.) I started gardening in the spring and though I didn’t know what I was doing then and still have no idea what I am doing now I have grown some cherry tomatoes, beats, raspberries, and I hope to have some pumpkins ready for Halloween.</p>

<p>Gardening had me looking into herbalism and the effects herbs can have on the body. Which made me interested in making soaps, salves, and other bath products. Another hobby was born. Although I don’t work on each hobby every day, I have moments that are mine in the garden with my plants or trying to make new soaps with different methods. I also have a sense of accomplishment when I harvest a tomato or a beat or see that I have green beans and pumpkins growing because that’s something I did and something I taught myself to do.</p> 

<p>The best part of having these hobbies isn’t the fact that I am learning new things but that my son is watching me teach myself how to do new things. He loves to help me water the garden and gets excited when he sees the vegetables grow. Even picks them, sometimes too early, but I can’t be mad that he is excited about the entire process just like me. Every time I try a new soap, he always wants to help me.</p>

<p>He wants to be part of my adventures and I want him to be as well because when he’s older I want him to explore his own interests. Roaming from one topic to another because it is important to be a master of all trades rather than just one.</p>

<p>My husband loves to work on computers. Taking them apart or building them from scratch. He loves to 3D print things. Anything technical he gets fascinated with. Take for example this website. It’s absolutely beautiful isn’t it. He built it from scratch, taught himself everything and I am so proud of him. What is even better is that he shares his knowledge with others. He has been teaching my younger brother the ways of the computer.</p>

<p>I hope to one day be as knowledgeable about my hobbies to share my expertise with the world so there is more information out there for more people to start hobbies for themselves.</p> 

<p>I have always wondered why some job applications ask what your hobbies are but now I understand. Having a hobby shows that you have dedication, a thirst for knowledge, and you aren’t afraid to learn new things.</p>
<p>If you feel like you are in a slump, stuck in a routine of chores rather than engaging your mind and spirit in new activities then please just stop. Seriously, stop. Look at the pile of laundry or dirty dishes and say, <strong>“not today!”</strong></p>

<p>Pick up a book you’ve been wanting to read or research about something you have always wanted to try. Pull up YouTube! I promise someone on YouTube is just waiting for you to click on their video so they can introduce you to a whole new world.</p>

<p>Whether you want to garden, ice skate, build robots, make soap, build computers, or knit stop worrying about what needs done around the house today and do it tomorrow. Today worry about yourself and open your mind to new opportunities.</p> 

<h3>Here is a list of free resources to learn about a new hobby today,</h3>

* Your local library, yes you read right. These still exist. Not only do library’s offer an enormous supply of resources but many libraries have workshops now a days. Our local library here even has a crafting center where they teach you how to make all sorts of things. 
* YouTube. Millions or how-to videos exists on YouTube with detailed step by step guides on all sorts of subjects.
* Google. You can google almost anything, and millions of websites, blogs, or videos come up for your disposal. Google has helped me answer a lot of questions about my garden and helped me find solutions to the problems I’ve come across. 
* Your friends. Talk to your friends about what you want to do. Who knows they may have some knowledge in the subject or know of someone you can talk to. 
* Look around for internships or shadow positions in the field you want to explore. 

<h2>Whatever you choose to learn roam freely and enjoy every adventure.</h2>
