title: So You Have A Stinky Dog
---

<p>If you read my last post then you know that my dog, Harper, ended up rolling around in a dead animal on our last camping trip. If you havenâ€™t read my last post its linked here ðŸ¡ª      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/First-Time-Camping">First Time Camping</a> </p>

<p>Now Iâ€™m pretty sure that I would rather my dog roll around in anything but a dead animal because the smell is absolutely awful. It really is sickly sweet smelling and is extremely hard to get rid of, but I found a way and I am here to share it with you.</p>

<p>First, I want to paint you a picture of the morning it happened and what we tried while we were still in the camp site.</p>

<p>It was early when I let the dogs out, around five in the morning. Usually I would let them to their business and jump back in bed because I may be many things but a morning person I am not. The view was beautiful though and the air was still and quiet, so I pulled up a chair to the edge of the water and watched the fish jumping and the sky change with the sunrise. </p>

<p>Our campsite on one side was full of trees, sage, and these tall weeds that all the dogs seemed to love to walk in. So, when harper started to roll around in those particular weeds, I didnâ€™t think anything about it other than, those dogs sure love the smell of that stuff. I let her and her ninety pounds flatten the weeds to her little heartâ€™s desire.</p>

<p>Then came the smell. If you came to this post to find out how to get rid of the smell, then you know how awful it is. I think I would even prefer the smell of a skunk over the stink that was clinging to Harperâ€™s fur. <h3>Rancid.</h3></p>

<p>Now if you are sitting there wondering why anything would roll around on a rotting animal then you were just like me as I sat in the cold lake submerging myself and my dog hoping that it would just rinse off. (it didnâ€™t) I did a little research when I got home, and dogs or other predators roll in dead animals to mask their scent to hunt. It all goes back to their ancestors the wolf and because harper is a Labrador and is essentially a hunting dog it all makes sense. </p>

<p>Okay, the rinse in the lake didnâ€™t work so we turned to dish soap because it was all we had as soap in the camper. We took harper by the lake but not in and not anywhere to soap would run off into the lake. Please do not get soap into a body of water. I scrubbed. Scrubbed some more. We rinsed her with a toy bucket and scrubbed even more.</p>

<h2>I donâ€™t suggest this method. It made her smell worse.</h2>

<p>The dish soapâ€™s scent mixed with the stench of the dead animal and only made it smell like a fruity dead animal. We were lost not knowing what we could do. All I could think was that she was going to be stuck in my car for an hour smelling like death and then my car will forever smell like death.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t remember who suggested the next idea either Garrett or his Mom, but we thought about how they use tomato juice for skunk smell. Well we didnâ€™t have any tomato juice, but we have Bloody Mary mix! It was sad to see all that Bloody Mary mix go to waste, but it was for a good cause. I gave Harper a tomato bath and we let it dry.</p> 

<p>Hallelujah the smell was gone! We were all happy that we didnâ€™t have to deal with that anymore! About loaded up to go home I decided to rinse harper so she could dry a bit before we got into the car. (Again, rinsing her away from the lake.) </p>

<h1>Noooooooooooooo!</h1>

<p>The smell was back, just as strong and just as fruity.</p>

<p>Fighting what seemed to be a losing battle we got in the car and opened the windows to make the drive back home. Once there I grabbed handy dandy google and started to research.</p>

<p>What I found was using baking soda, Hydrogen peroxide, and dish soap was what to use to get rid of the smell. I mixed them all up in a spray bottle filling about a third of the bottle with peroxide and dish soap. Adding about a table spoon of baking soda and filling the rest with warm water. Giving it a good long shake, I started giving Harper a bath with it.</p>

<p>After I rinsed the concoction from her fur the smell was finally gone for the most part. For good measure I washed her with the mixture one more time and then after rinsing that I used our dog shampoo to help moisturize the skin underneath.</p>

<p>I ended up having to soak her dog collar in the mixture as well and let it sit for about twenty minutes to get the smell off of that.</p>

<h1>The smell was finally gone!</h1> <p>I was happy, Garrett was happy, and Harper was happy she could come inside again.</p>

<p>My car did not smell like death after all because during our camping trip a bottle of flea and tick spray I brought along for the pups exploded all over the back-hatch area. Leaving my car to smell like menthol instead. No idea how to get that smell out just yet.</p>

<h3>Thanks for enjoying my journey.</h3>
